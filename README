----------------------------------------------
WHAT I HAVE DONE IN THE ASSIGNMENT

This is a socket programming project. Because I have not touched on socket programming at all before, first thing I did is to just

learn it by myself. I read Beej’s Guide to Network Programming several times.Then I write the code for this project. I build a TCP 

connection between client and edge, through which client can send data to edge and edge can send computation results to client. I 

build also connections be between edge and serever_or, server_and. If it is a ‘and’ operation, edge will send data to serever_and, 

otherwise it will send to serever_or. After server_or or serever_and compute it, it will send back to edge and edge will send back 

to client, then client get result. I implemented these functions.

----------------------------------------------
CODE FILES AND FUNCTIONS

I have seven files in all: client.c, edge.c, server_or.c, server_and.c, makefile, job.txt, README

client.c: read data form input file, build TCP connection between client and edge server, send data to edge server.

edge.c: get data from client, build UDP connection between edge and serever_or, server_and, process data, send them to  serever_or or server_and by operation.

server_or.c: get data from edge, binary ‘or’ operation , send back results to edge.

server_and.c: get data from edge, binary ‘and’ operation , send back results to edge.

makefile.txt: facilitate to use ‘make’ unix command to compile and run source files.

job.txt : testing data.

----------------------------------------------
RUN PROGRAM

Just the same as requirement in tutorial.


----------------------------------------------
FORMAT OF MESSAGES

The same as job.txt


----------------------------------------------
IDIOSYNCRASY OF MY PROJECT

Till now, I don’t find bug in the programming.
